# Confidential Documents Store (Credentials store)

## Overview
 - This project is a document store. The document is to be stored in git service such as GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab in an encrypted form.
 - The project is envisioned as a Front-end application.
 - The application should have a log in screen. The login screen should be backed by the Git Service provider.
 - Post logging in to the application, the encryption phrase is set.
 - This phrase is used to encrypt/decrypt the text documents.
 - As the authentication is already completed, the encrypted documents are stored in Git repository.
 - It is important to note each encryption/decryption happens on the browser. Unencrypted document does not leave the browser.
